# SoFi
---
Located in the Presidio in San Francisco, SoFi was started in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, who were Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) students. Sofi originally started originally using an alumni funded lending model to connect recent grads with alumni in their community, it then introduced Student Loan Refinancing, becoming the first company to refinance federal and private student loans. SoFI primarily makes money primarily through securitizations and whole loan sales. The buyers in these securitizations are institutions like pension and insurance funds, as well as other asset managers, who pay a premium upfront for the future potential cash flows from the loans.SoFi’s total funding altogether is $2.3 billion. According to SoFi’s release about funding, its pre-money valuation is $4.3 billion, the same valuation it was assigned at the time of that Silver Lake-led round two years ago.

## Business Activities:

The specific financial problem that SoFI is hoping to solve is to lower loan rates. SoFi’s  loan rates are lower than Federal Direct and PLUS loans, and this delivers real savings that reduce student and graduate debt burdens. Graduates who have refinanced with them have saved an average of over $9,600. Students are able to avoid costly origination fees and reduce annual payments by $2,500 or more. SoFi also offers critical education to borrowers. SoFi released an online application that allows you to enter your school, your major, where you plan on living when you graduate and how much debt you plan on incurring. SoFi started in 2011 with a focus on millennial student-loan refinancing but has since expanded to personal and mortgage loans, mortgage refinances and wealth management services. It said it has more than 700,000 members and 7.5 million registered users.
Depending on your credit score and income, you could qualify for a much lower rate with SoFi than you would with a federal student loan. SoFi student loans have fixed interest rates as low as 3.20% and variable rates as low as 2.99%. Lower interest rates can result in significant savings. SoFi Parent Loans don’t have origination or application fees, which can help you save even more.When you take out a loan through SoFi, you get access to special member perks, including career support. You’ll get the chance to work one-on-one with a career coach, who can help you navigate the transition into a new field, update your resume, and build your personal brand. SoFi also offers personalized wealth management advice to its members. The advisors can help you with everything from identifying investments to defining your future plans.

## Results
---
SoFi, the leading marketplace lender for financially responsible consumers, today announced it has surpassed $6 billion in funded loans across mortgages, personal loans, and student loan refinancing.

## Recommendations
SoFi’s expensive marketing machine appeared to at least be delivering high-quality prime borrowers at a reliable clip. But customers missed loan payments at an “unexpectedly high rate” in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal. SoFi may have to update the company’s credit models and revisit its marketing strategy in order to get loan performance back on track.SoFi also only offers up to 12 months of forbearance as opposed to their  competitors who offer longer periods. In order to be more of an incentive for a prospective customer to be more likely to choose SoFi they could match or increase the length of forbearance they offer to their customers as opposed to their competitors.
